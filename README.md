# Public-Test-Videos
In light of Open Source Month / HacktoberFest 2021
An api that returns video data as there no open projects. Used @jsturgis gist as data


This project came as an idea to help out a friend who needed an open source project or  api that had videos for use in a frontend application.


https://public-videos-api.herokuapp.com


Documentation:
/videos : Returns all videos.


I am currently not allowing create video in this api because i would not like to host videos from others as it may go against cause security and privacy.

Something new I learnt: Heroku starts applications only on TCP/80 or PORT 80.
